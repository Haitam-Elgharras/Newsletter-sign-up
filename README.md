## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I Learned

During this project, I had the opportunity to practice my skills in form validation and creating success messages. I also gained more familiarity with the Tailwind CSS framework and its utility classes.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to further enhance my understanding of form validation techniques and explore more advanced CSS frameworks and libraries to expand my skill set.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The official documentation for Tailwind CSS was a valuable resource for learning about the utility classes and available components.
